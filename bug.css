The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not produce the expected result if the parent element has padding or border.  Another common issue is forgetting spaces between operators and values within `calc()`, e.g. `calc(100%-10px)` will often fail to parse correctly.  Finally, incompatible units within a single `calc()` expression can cause problems.
